## Maven

## LOMBOK

-1 Project -> maven (pom.xml) -> add a new dependency -> lombok
-2 mvn compile -> download classes (Getter, Setter, ToString, etc...)
-3 Inject all those classes into your maven project
-4 Annotate "@Getter" in your class -> import those classes into your class

- Java Compile-time vs Lombok ( External Library )
- Java doesn't understand the meaning of @Getter
- Lombok Library "teach" Java Compiler how to convert to Java code before compile
- Annotations (@Getter) -> compile
